Do you use your IDE as a simple editor? 
Do yo rename variables and methods manually across the code? 
Maybe you type manually your getters and setters too?
And maybe you debug your code by just pressing the "step" and hope for the best...

Starting from today, you can now focus on the problem, rather than the code!
Your IDE has plenty of functionalities that helps you write and manipulate your code in an easy way.
And most of the functions have shortcuts, so you will never have to leave your keyboard 
for your mouse when doing some mundane refactoring (sorry mices, nothing wrong with ya!). 

We have selected the best and most useful plugins, functions, and shortcuts for the Eclipse IDE.
You can find them on the [wiki page](https://github.com/notsojug/jug-material/wiki/Eclipse) of the jug material :)

Happy Coding!
