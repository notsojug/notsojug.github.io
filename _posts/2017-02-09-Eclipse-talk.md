### Thou shalt know the tools

Eclipse is a very old friend of Java developers, but some treat it as a second class editor...oh wait...did you read "editor"?

Do you know that Eclipse is not _just_ a editor? You are mistreating it!

Here we present you the Eclipse Talk, where you can find useful info regarding this IDE (that's right, **IDE**).

You can read the slides on [https://raw.githack.com/notsojug/jug-material/master/eclipse/slides/index.html](https://raw.githack.com/notsojug/jug-material/master/eclipse/slides/index.html)

Please check also the [wiki page](https://github.com/notsojug/jug-material/wiki/Eclipse) of the jug material for further information.

Happy Coding!
