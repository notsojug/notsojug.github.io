### Finally here!

Hello! We are a bunch of passionate Java developers who like good code design and _sane_ use of libraries.

This project is an experiment started as a self-teaching initiative between colleagues.

Over time we piled up some interesting study material into a github repository; the initiative went by so we thought about giving it a name rather than _parking some code_ in a personal repository.

We believe this can be categorized under the JUG definition, as per [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_User_Group):

>A **Java User Group (JUG)** is a community of users of the Java programming language.
>
>Typically, members of a JUG support each other through:
>
>1. regular meetings (e.g. monthly)
>2. mailing lists
>3. a collaborative website or wiki
>4. study groups for Java certification exams

Since we don't meet 1, 2, and 4, but we would be a community of users that study the Java programming language (_and its neighborhood_), we have called it **"Not So JUG"**.

So... Everyone is welcome to contribute and join the project!
